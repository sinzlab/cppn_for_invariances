# Learning Invariance Manifold via CPPNs

We present a systematic data-driven approach based on implicit image representations and contrastive learning, that allows the identification and parameterization of the manifold of highly activating stimuli, for visual sensory neurons.
We tested our method on simple [Gabor-based model neurons](https://github.com/sinzlab/cppn_for_invariances/tree/main/notebooks/simulated_data) with known (and exact) invariances as well as neural network models predicting the responses of [macaque V1 neurons](https://github.com/sinzlab/cppn_for_invariances/blob/main/notebooks/macaqueV1/find_invariance.ipynb).
